## <span style="color:red"><strong>TODO:</strong></span> (Re)naming of the student repository (for submitting the assignments)

***INSTRUCTIONS*** for naming the student's repository for assignments (with one student):
* Students need to use the following name for the repository with their solutions: `e4750-2024fall-assignments-UNI` (the default name "e4750_2024Fall_students_repo" will be inherited from the assignment repository, so students need to change it)
* Initially, the system may give the repository a name which ends with a student's Github user ID. The student should eliminate that name and replace it with the UNI as requested in the point above
  * Good Example: `e4750-2024fall-assignments-zz9999`
  * Bad example: `e4750-2024fall-assignments-e4750-2024fall-assign0-zz9999`
* This change can be done from the "Settings" tab which is located on the repository page.

***INSTRUCTIONS*** for naming the students' solution repository for assignments with more students, such as the final project (students need to use a 4-letter groupID):
* Template: `e4750-2024fall-Project-GroupID-UNI1-UNI2`
* Example: `e4750-2024fall-Project-MEME-zz9999-aa9999`
