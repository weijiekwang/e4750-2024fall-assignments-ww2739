### Hints


This [git wiki page](https://github.com/eecse4750/e4750_2024Fall_students_repo/wiki) has relevant tutorials to help you get started.

These concepts will help you write code that executes the expected outputs:
1. Synchronization:

As you read more on this, think about why it is an important part of a code for a heterogeneous system and also specifically how you will use it for this assignment.

    1. There are two ways to synchronize threads across blocks in PyCuda:
        1. Using pycuda.driver.Context.synchronize()
        2. Using CUDA Events. Usually using CUDA Events is a better way to synchronize, for details you can go through: [https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/how-implement-performance-metrics-cuda-cc/] , its a short interesting read.
            1. For using CUDA events you will get an instance of cuda event using cuda.event(), example: event = cuda.event().
            2. You will also time cuda events by recording particular time instances using event.record().
            3. You will synchronize all threads in an event using event.synchronize().
            4. For example you can refer to a brief part of assignment solution I showed during my recitation :). There is a minor issue with that code though but the idea is correct.
            5. Note: you need to synchronize event.record() too.
            6. You will use cuda events time_till to record execution time. 
   
    
    2. To Synchronize PyOpenCL kernels you have to use kernel.wait() functionality. PyOpenCL kernels are by default executed as an event afaik.

## Problem Setup

You will perform parallel vector addition in this assignment. The goal is to help you get comfortable with PyCUDA and PyOpenCL while solving an introductory problem whose execution on a GPU is straightforward. You will be introduced to essential aspects of computing with CUDA and OpenCL through their Python wrappers (the concepts used in the wrappers translate to the respective functions in the native programs). In addition to this, you will profile the programs to evaluate the effectiveness of introducing parallelism. You will profile using two methods—one using timestamps and the other using NVIDIA's Nsight application.

The template given in the main function iterates through a 1D vector - $[1,2,..,N]$, with $N$ taking values of $(10,10^2,10^3...10^8)$ for different CPU/GPU implementations of vector addition. Note that the vectors used are numpy arrays with the float32 datatype. (What is the reason for using float32 type ?)

The CPU methods are provided directly and you are expected to complete the GPU methods. 
### CPU Methods
There are two version of the CPU code
1. `CPU_numpy_Add` : Numpy addition of vectors
2. `CPU_Loop_Add` : Addition of a scalar to a vector using a for loop

### GPU Methods
The GPU methods differ slightly for pycuda and pyopencl
1. Each includes a direct utilization of kernels with

### Tasks

#### Kernels

`This section is worth 15 points`

You will write kernels for both PyCUDA and PyOpenCL solutions. There are four kernels that you have to complete in total; two each for PyCUDA and PyOpenCL - `Add_two_vectors_GPU` and `Add_to_each_element_GPU`.

One kernel has been completed for your reference. The other three are to be finished by you and each carries 5 points.

1. `Add_two_vectors_GPU`: A vector matching the input length containing the same scalar for each index $b$ is to be added to the input.
2. `Add_to_each_element_GPU`: A scalar $b$ is to be added to the input vector.

Note: The scalar $b$ is of type float32 (Think about why this is)

In the following section, the `is_b_a_vector` will be used to choose which kernel is used for computation.

#### PyCUDA code 

`This section is worth 40 points`

In each scenario, the `SourceModule` functionality will be used to compile the written kernel, that will be used to perform the parallel computation on the device.


There are four methods to be completed 
1. *(10 points)* `add_device_mem_gpu`:
   
    Both (`Add_two_vectors_GPU`, `Add_to_each_element_GPU`) operations will be performed using explicit device memory allocations using `pycuda.driver.mem_alloc()`. Note that you need to retieve the computed result from the device to the host using the appropriate API. Record the following:

   i. Execution time including memory transfer (HostToDevice copy + Kernel + DeviceToHost copy).
   
   ii. Execution time excluding memory transfer (Only Kernel). 
2. *(10 points)* `add_host_mem_gpu`:

   Both operations will be performed without explicit device memory allocations (Which method of pycuda.driver will do this?).
   Record the following:

   i. Execution time including memory transfer.

    Why not execution time without memory transfer?
   
3. *(4 points)* `add_gpuarray_kernel`:

    Complete this method using the `gpuarray` functionality instead of `mem_alloc` while performing computation **with** the kernel written by you. For the  `Add_to_each_element_GPU` operation, can you directly use the numpy scalar value, or do you have to convert it to an array? Record the following:
   
   i. Execution time including memory transfer (HostToDevice copy + Kernel + DeviceToHost copy).
   
   ii. Execution time excluding memory transfer (Only Kernel). 


4. *(4 points)* `add_gpuarray_no_kernel`:

    Complete this method using the `gpuarray` functionality instead of `mem_alloc` while performing computation **without** the kernel written by you (Use numpy like syntax - add vectors sent to gpu directly). Record the following:
   
   i. Execution time including memory transfer (HostToDevice copy + Kernel + DeviceToHost copy).
   
   ii. Execution time excluding memory transfer (Only Kernel). 

Compare the results with `CPU_numpy_Add`. 

In addition to these methods, also complete the profiling section of the code.


5. Call each of the eight `GPU` cases and two `CPU` cases one by one for each vector length $(10,10^2,..,10^6)$. Run loops for each operation, for each vector size, for each iteration, for each method. The following order of precedence is to be followed in the loop.

```python
for operation in operations: #(add vector/ add scalar)
    for size in vector sizes: # (10^1,10^2,...,10^N)
        for iter in iterations: #(set as 50)
            for method in methods: #(GPU/CPU)
                # compute and save execution time
       #compute average time
```
6. Now exclude the slower of the two CPU cases and extend the same analysis for vector lengths $(10,10^2,..,10^8)$

7. *(4 points)* Plot the average execution times, including memory transfer for GPU operations, against vector size (display power of 10 in xticks ranging from $1$ to $8$).

8. *(4 points)* Plot the average execution times, excluding memory transfer for GPU operations, against vector size (display power of 10 in xticks ranging from $1$ to $8$).

9. *(4 points)* Profile `add_device_mem_gpu` for both operations - `Add_to_each_element_GPU` and `Add_two_vectors_GPU` kernels (Choose the vector size as $10^6$). Explain the differences seen. For profiling use NVIDIA Nsight Compute CLI. Also visualize generated report with Nsight Compute UI. Submit the generated report and add screenshots of the report opened with the UI.

Instructions on using the Nsight Tools are available in the Wiki.

#### PyOpenCL code

`This section is worth 25 points`

There are two methods to be completed.

1. *(10 points)* `deviceAdd`:

Complete the method to perform both operations (`Add_two_vectors_GPU`, `Add_to_each_element_GPU`) using `pyopencl.array` to load inputs to device memory. Record execution time including memory transfers.

2. *(10 points)* `bufferAdd`:

Complete the method to perform both operations using `pyopencl.Buffer` to load inputs to device memory. Record execution time including memory transfers.

In addition to these, complete the profiling section of the code

3. Call each of the four `GPU` cases and two `CPU` cases one by one for each vector length $(10,10^2,..,10^6)$. Run loops for each operation, for each vector size, for each iteration (set max iterations as $50$), for each method. The following order of precedence is to be followed in the loop.

```python
for operation in operations: #(add vector/ add scalar)
    for size in vector sizes: # (10^1,10^2,...,10^N)
        for iter in iterations: #(set as 50)
            for method in methods: #(GPU/CPU)
                # compute and save execution time
       #compute average time
```

4.  Now exclude the slower of the two CPU cases and extend the same analysis for vector lengths $(10,10^2,..,10^8)$. There are now five cases - four GPU + one CPU.

5. *(5 points)* Plot the average execution times for the four GPU cases and the faster CPU case against vector size (display power of 10 in xticks ranging from $1$ to $8$).
